# freedom

Record your life, review when you have time.

## Getting Started

```bash
# flutter 3.10.0, other version can't run it. I suggest you abandon flutter and android development chain, because it is not stable.
# flutter config --no-analytics
# dart --disable-analytics  

flutter pub get -v

flutter run

flutter build apk --release
```

## Dev Plans

* Put all those data into the `Downloads` folder.
* Drop dart and flutter since I found their map or dict or hash table will take 1 second to get an item from 120000 elements. It is slower than python about 1000 times. (They want to force you use newest version of flutter and dart.)

## Future Plan
If the building chain size is still go up and keep unstable, I will consider using my pen and paper to write diary without using computer.

The main reason is "to maintain the freedom in an un_freedom device is too hard."
