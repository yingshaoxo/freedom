Record your life, review when you have time.

## Getting Started

```bash
# flutter 3.10.0, other version can't run it. I suggest you abandon flutter and android development chain, because it is not stable.
# flutter config --no-analytics
# dart --disable-analytics  

flutter pub get -v

flutter run

flutter build apk --release
```

## Dev Plans

* Put all those data into the `Downloads` folder.
